  ## FlexPicture app
  
  FlexPicture - this is a very simple application that essentially has only one screen, the whole point in the algorithm for selecting images. 
  The application provides a simple interface where the user is shown pictures on topics that are of interest to him and depending on the choice, the application itself decides   which picture to show next. Factors can be many things from the real world, for example: politics, culture, pop culture, music, etc.
